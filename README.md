# TODAY'S MEAL SEARCHER

> * :warning: One of my very early projects completed during my front-end and basic JavaScript learning. Since that time, I have gained a lot of skills, and today it would look completely different :see_no_evil: I leave the code in the repository as a trace of my learning process from 2020 for comparison with current projects. *

### Single Page App, Response Web Design, static HTML
**The goal** was to create simple Single Paga App with use of VanillaJS only and to play with a free public API.

The key part of **the design** are photographs of food which should encourage cooking.

To obtain **SPA with VanillaJS**, one base HTML file was created with basic elemens structure. Sections are displayed by their class manipulation if needed, fetched data results in creating elements to display in the draft.

Elemens and data are **dynamically created** and appended to display by JS app engine depending the response **from API.** Response depends the search word send to the API via form field.
